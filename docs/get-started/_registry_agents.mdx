## Overview

The ACP Registry is an easy way for developers to distribute their ACP-compatible agents to any client that speaks the protocol.

At the moment, this is a curated set of agents, including only the ones that [support authentication](/rfds/auth-methods).

Visit [the registry repository on GitHub](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/registry) to learn more about it.

<Warning>
  The registry is under active development, so expect its format and contents to
  change.

## Using the Registry

Clients can fetch the registry programmatically:

```bash
curl https://cdn.agentclientprotocol.com/registry/v1/latest/registry.json
```

The registry JSON contains all agent metadata including distribution information for automatic installation.

## Submit your Agent

To add your agent to the registry:

1. Fork the [registry repository on GitHub](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/registry)
2. Create a folder with your agent's ID (lowercase, hyphens allowed)
3. Add an `agent.json` file following [the schema](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/registry/blob/main/agent.schema.json)
4. Optionally add an `icon.svg` (16x16 recommended)
5. Submit a pull request

See the [contributing guide](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/registry/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.
