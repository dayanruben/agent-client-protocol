The ACP Agent Registry is a curated collection of agents implementing the Agent Client Protocol.

## Available Agents

$$AGENTS_CARDS$$

<Warning>
  **Work in Progress**: This registry is under active development. Format and
  contents may change.
</Warning>

<Note>
  This registry only includes agents that support
  [authentication](/rfds/auth-methods). Agents must implement auth flows to be
  listed here. Not all ACP-compatible agents are listed yet—as soon as they're
  ready, we'll be happy to add them.
</Note>

<Info>
  The registry is hosted at
  [github.com/agentclientprotocol/registry](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/registry).
  Visit the repository to contribute your own agent.

## Using the Registry

Clients can fetch the registry programmatically:

```bash
curl https://cdn.agentclientprotocol.com/registry/v1/latest/registry.json
```

The registry JSON contains all agent metadata including distribution information for automatic installation.

1. Fork the [registry repository](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/registry)

3. Add an `agent.json` file following the [schema](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/registry/blob/main/agent.schema.json)
4. Optionally add an `icon.svg` (16x16 recommended)
5. Submit a pull request
